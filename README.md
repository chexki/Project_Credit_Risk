This dataset belongs to the Bank Indessa where the help is needed by predicting the probability that a member will default. The data is divided into train ( June 2007 - May 2015 ) and out-of-time test ( June 2015 - Dec 2015 ) as per the problem statement.

Models Applied : Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~ 70 %

As it turns out, The bank has more number of customers capable enough to pay off the loan according to their credit history. Though, the possibility of overfitting ( in case of Decision tree model) or underfitting of the models can not be denied. 
    The Project overall gives basic understanding of the credit industry and also an idea about how analytics and data science is applied in practice in the BFSI domain.
